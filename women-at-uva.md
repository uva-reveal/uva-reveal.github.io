“A plan of female education has never been a subject of systematic contemplation with me” - Thomas Jefferson

Women have always inhabited the University of Virginia: as wives, as mothers, as slaves. But it wasn’t until the 1880s that women began attending the school as students, and UVA did not become fully coeducational until 1973. Women have fought for entrance into Jefferson’s school repeatedly over the university’s long history.

Women began enrolling at UVA for this first time in the summer of 1880. That year, the University became the host to Virginia's first Normal School for teacher training. Teaching was one of the few professions open to women in the 1800s, and as such, over half of the attendees of the 1880 normal school were women.

In 1892, Caroline Preston Davis petitioned for permission to take the school’s graduating examinations in a field typically dominated by men: mathematics. Caroline Davis's work was such high quality that she was awarded distinction. Nonetheless, UVA would not grant her a degree. She was given a certificate of proficiency instead. Davis was the first of a small group of white women who were allowed to attend UVA as “special students” in the 1890s. During this time, women were not aloud to take classes with men, but they were aloud to be tutored individually and to take university exams. This small window of opportunity was brief, however, as the Board of Visitors voted to prohibit any woman from enrolling in these programs in the future just two years later, in 1894.

Women’s colleges and coeducational opportunities were growing in America by the 1900s. By 1900, 71% of US colleges and universities were coeducational to some degree. Yet, at the turn of the twentieth-century, there were no still four-year colleges for women in the state of Virginia. This led Mary Mumford of Richmond to spearhead an effort in 1910 to establish a coordinate college for women at the University of Virginia. Coordination would have allowed women to have access to their own, women-only classes at a sister college in Charlottesville while still utilizing the library, laboratories, and teaching staff at UVA. Even this was too much for the elite men of the legislature and UVA. The proposal to establish a coordinate college at UVA was voted down every year from 1910 to 1920.

However, the university did remain open to women in special summer courses. Among the women learning and teaching at UVA in the 1910s was famous artist Georgia O’Keeffe. O’Keeffe enrolled in drawing classes at the University of Virginia in 1912. The very next year, O’Keeffe was teaching her own class at the school. See O’Keeffe’s early paintings of the Rotunda in the far left. (insert screenshot?)

In 1920, the University of Virginia opened its graduate and professional program to select  women. The first female law school graduate was Elizabeth Tompkins, who graduated in 1923. However, when Alice Carlotta Jackson tried to take advantage of this new opportunity in 1935, Alice was denied not because of her gender, but because of her race. Alice was the first known African American to apply to a graduate school in Virginia. Alice grew up in Richmond, Virginia, and received her BA in English from Virginia Union University. She attempted to enroll in UVA's French Master's Program. The UVA Board of Visitors denied her entrance based on the Jim Crow laws and “other good and sufficient reasons.” Barred from higher education in her home state, Jackson earned her M.A. from Columbia University in New York City. Jackson went on to spend a lifetime teaching and advocating for civil rights. After her passing in 2001, Jackson’s family donated her personal papers to the Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia.

The UVA Board of Visitors finally voted to allow women entrance into all programs in 1969 with plan to admit female students gradually. In 1969, UVA would accept qualified wives and daughters of male students and staff members at UVA. The University would then gradually increase their numbers, capping female enrollment at 35% of the student body by 1980.

This halting pace was not enough for the four women who sued to gain entrance to the university in the spring of 1969. Virginia Scott, Nancy Jaffe, Nancy Anderson, and Jo Anne Kirstein filed a complaint arguing that UVA “severely discriminates against women in their admissions policies.” John Lowe, a recent UVA law school alum and American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, represented the four women. The court ultimately agreed with these women, and it ordered UVA to become fully coeducational within three years.

Once women gained admittance to the University, they worked to improve their conditions on Grounds, fighting for equal access to residential facilities, bathrooms, student groups, and sports programs. In 1972, Cynthia Goodrich became the first female resident of the Lawn. In 1989, University of Virginia students began to organize Take Back the Night marches to protest sexual assault on campus. A consortium of UVA organizations continue to host Take Back the Night events every April. These students help lead the effort to protect and empower victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, no matter what their gender or sexual orientation.
