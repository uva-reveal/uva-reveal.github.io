## Project Description
The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort has moved the material history of UVA out of Special Collections and onto Grounds. Using mobile Augmented Reality applications, *UVA Reveal: Augmenting the University* explores otherwise hidden stories, histories, and questions surrounding objects and spaces at UVA. In doing so, we hope to prompt users to re-examine everyday environs and critically reflect on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the university.

## App Description

*UVA Reveal: Augmenting the University* is an app that employs augmented reality to display information (including text, images, and videos) about various sites around the University of Virginia grounds. In so doing, *UVA Reveal* helps uncover the history of and connections between spaces at the university. To download our app, please visit *X*.

## Acknowledgements

The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort would like to thank the UVA Scholars' Lab staff for their time and financial support, without which this project would not be possible. In particular, we thank Jeremy Boggs, Zoe LeBlanc, and Shane Lin for their development expertise; Ronda Grizzle, Amanda Visconti, and Brandon Walsh for project management advice; Drew Macqueen for his assistance with GIS; and last - but certainly not least - Arin Bennett for his invaluable insights and patience in teaching us how to use Unity.
