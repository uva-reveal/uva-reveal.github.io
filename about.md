## Project Description
The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort has moved the material history of UVA out of Special Collections and onto Grounds. Using mobile Augmented Reality applications, Augmenting the University explores otherwise hidden stories, histories, and questions surrounding objects and spaces at UVA. In doing so, we hope to prompt users to re-examine everyday environs and critically reflect on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the university.

## App Description

UVA Reveal: Augmenting the University is an app that employs augmented reality to display information (including text, images, and videos) about various sites around the University of Virginia grounds. In so doing, UVA Reveal helps uncover the history of and connections between spaces at the university. For more information, please visit our website: reveal.scholarslab.org.
