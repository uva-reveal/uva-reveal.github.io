## Project Description
The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort has moved the material history of UVA out of Special Collections and onto Grounds. Using mobile Artificial Reality applications, Augmenting the University explores otherwise hidden stories, histories, and questions surrounding objects and spaces at UVA. In doing so, we hope to prompt users to re-examine everyday environs and critically reflect on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the university.

## Project Workflow
We designed Augmenting the University as a project that allows the user to reveal layers of meaning and various utilization through cross-platform engagement. Much like the design and thesis of our project, we let the development and implementation process reveal itself to us in various layers.

We began with a shared interest in public-facing digital humanities.

1. Moved toward an interest in local scholarship
2. Thought about using the library for accessibility as well as community engagement outside of just the university
3. Moved toward wanting to understand the connection between UVa’s history, Charlottesville, and access to education, broadly conceived
  * Decided a good way to deal with that would be to connect sites on grounds to larger cultural and historical contexts
4. How, then, should we do that?
  * After a long discussion about accessibility and universal design, we decided on a VR project through a mobile app with a supplementary website for additional content that also serves on its own as a standalone way to explore our project
  * The VR app is built on a Unity platform that allows scans of library objects, videos, websites, sound materials, and other sources to appear on a related site or object when scanned by the phone’s camera.
  * For the website, we wanted to keep the concept of “revealing” while providing a different user experience. Rather than using Unity, we are building a website using CSS and Javascript to visually connect various media with UVa locations in a discoverable manner.
  * From the beginning, we were also interested in creating a reproducible, documented project for likeminded scholars to follow. Toward this aim, we are documenting our workflow.
  * We are also creating an alternative way to search Special Collections materials to enhance discoverability in library searches to better connect university materials with locations or larger political, cultural, or historical concepts on grounds. This process uses Javascript to query existing JSON library data.
5. When a user engages on the app, they can have a full experience on location.
  * They may, however, be directed toward the webpage for additional content, and will be prompted to visit the website off location for additional project information or for further learning.
  * If a user is interested in their own version of Augmenting the University, they will find full documentation of Unity and the mobile platform on the website.
6. When a user engages on the website, they will also have a full experience, yet from their computer rather than on location.
  * They will have full documentation of what the app can do and a video walkthrough. They will also be given instructions for how to engage on location with the app.
  * This user will also gain access to the library search project, allowing them to browse through UVa library collections based on their selected search terms.
  * They will also see full documentation of the library search project so that interested parties can engage in similar work.
