## About the Project
The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort has moved the material history of UVA out of Special Collections and onto Grounds. Using augmented reality (AR) applications, our project, titled *UVA Reveal: Augmenting the University*, challenges the surface of our perceptions of objects and places. *UVA Reveal* thus explores otherwise hidden stories, histories, and questions surrounding objects and spaces at UVA. In doing so, we hope to prompt users to re-examine everyday environs and critically reflect on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the university.

## Background of the Project
Augmented reality applications are becoming increasingly prevalent in society (witness Pokémon Go) and in the academy. For instance, a DH project titled *The Whole Story* uses an app that allows users to build AR statues of women and place them in the spatial landscape for others to see. By putting women back in the narrative, the app challenges the unequal statuary landscape and its implication that men are the makers of history. The digital spaces created by AR thus assume an openness and mobility that is lacking in physical space,[^footnote] which may be controlled or limited by socio-economic and political reasons. Nonetheless, these spatial boundaries can seemingly be circumvented in digital spaces, and users can move rapidly across zones that they would be unable to otherwise. *UVA Reveal* is thus designed to explore how real spaces can be experienced through changing, mobile technologies that enable spatial and temporal augmentation. 
The objects of our investigation include both buildings and documents at or connected to UVA, especially documents from the special collections library. 

[^footnote]: We recognize that the same can be said about digital spaces, i.e. firewalls, paying services, language barriers, profile/password credentials, profiles set to private, digital literacy, etc. Our project, however, is open-source and freely available to the public.

## App Description
Our project uses Unity to layer 3D models on images – including university buildings and physical objects – that will enable the viewer to experience the virtual layering of time upon an object. Unity is easily exportable to Android, iOS, and HoloLens platforms, and we have created an app with which our users will be able to engage the AR experience (including the virtual display of text, images, and videos upon physical objects) through their personal devices. In so doing, *UVA Reveal* helps uncover the history of and connections between spaces at the university. To download our app, please visit *X*.

## Acknowledgements
The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort would like to thank the UVA Scholars' Lab staff for their time and financial support, without which this project would not be possible. In particular, we thank Jeremy Boggs, Zoe LeBlanc, and Shane Lin for their development expertise; Ronda Grizzle, Amanda Visconti, and Brandon Walsh for project management advice; Drew Macqueen for his assistance with GIS; and last -but certainly not least- Arin Bennett for his invaluable insights and patience in teaching us how to use Unity.
