## Project Description
The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort has moved the material history of UVA out of Special Collections and onto Grounds. Using mobile Artificial Reality applications, Augmenting the University explores otherwise hidden stories, histories, and questions surrounding objects and spaces at UVA. In doing so, we hope to prompt users to re-examine everyday environs and critically reflect on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the university.
